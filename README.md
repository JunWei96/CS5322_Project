## Order of Scripts
If you are starting from a fresh database, here is the sequence of script you should run:
`schema.sql` > `load_packages` > `load_data.sql` > `load_policies.sql`

If you are working on an existing database with existing data and you want to reset the database to its original form, you can run `reset.sql`.

After you are done running the setup scripts, you can run the test cases by logging into the respective user's account and run their respective scripts there.
